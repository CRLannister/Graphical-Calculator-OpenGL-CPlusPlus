# Sem11OOP

## 3rd semester OOP Project on Graphulator.
> It is aimed to process all the calculating processes along with the Graphical presentation.

## Languages and Technologies Used

    - Programming Language: C++
    - Graphics: OpenGL

## Key Features

    - Calculation Processes: Efficient handling and processing of mathematical and computational tasks.
    - Graphical Presentation: Visual representation of calculations using OpenGL.

## Languages used:C++ and Graphics is targeted to use OpenGl specification.

The Sem11OOP project, Graphulator, combines the power of C++ for processing calculations with the graphical capabilities of OpenGL to deliver a robust and visually appealing computational tool. This project not only strengthens understanding of OOP principles but also provides practical experience in integrating complex calculations with graphical outputs.
